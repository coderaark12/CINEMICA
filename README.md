Movies are the one people choose more as their
entertainment purpose. So our group decided to fulfill
peopleâ€™s wish and provide them with a online way to
book tickets with just few clicks. 


The main objective behind this project is to provide a user
friendly environment to provide knowledge and give everyone
a chance to learn, irrespective of where they are, provided
they register themselves with the system. The main features
that the system provides can be made use of, once the
registered people select their interested subject and take a
starter test. This helps to establish incremental learning
process. After taking this, based on their level of competence,
they can take available tutorials, take online tests and also
discuss an issue/topic by posting messages in the discussion
forum. Along with this they can also take real time simulations
of the most widely known competitive exams.
